.SH ENCODER PARAMETERS STRING

Module-dependent parameters can be passed to encoder using the -F transcode(1) option:

.RS 4
.B transcode \-F \fIcodec_string\fP
.RE

Those parameters tune the general behaviour of the export module. More specific settings can fine-tune the
export settings. Those settings are passed to export modules through \fBmodule options\fP or through
the \fBmodule configuration file\fP; both configuration file and options can be present at same time:
in that case, the options overrides the configuration file. Passing option strings to export modules
is done like to pass options to filter modules:
The syntax is:

.RS 4
.B transcode \-y vmod=options,amod=options
.RE

see transcode_filter(1) for full reference and examples.

The \-F parameter has different meanings for different export modules, as documented on section below.

.SH ENCODER MODULES PARAMETERS

.TP
\fIffmpeg\fP:
  The codec String for the codec you want to encode. Example values are -F mpeg4 or -F mpeg1video or -F huffyuv. To get a list of valid codecs, use -F list

.TP
\fIim\fP:
  The name of the image format you want to export. Example values are '-F jpg' (default) or '-F png' or -F 'gif'. With -F jpg, -w gives quality in percent. With -F png, the first digit of -w gives compression level, the second one gives quality, so -w 95 selects best compression level (9) and 5 means PNG adaptive filtering.

.TP
\fIjpg\fP:
  The quality of the JPEG encode in percent. Example values are '-F 75' (default) or '-F 100'

.TP
\fImov\fP:
  Syntax: -F "<vcodec>,<acodec>[,<parameters>]"
    <vcodec> = Videocodec to encode with. Default: "mjpa"
    <acodec> = Audiocodec to encode with. Default: "ima4"
    <parameters> = A comma seperated list of parameters
                   to be passed to the codec.

Note: You can use "list" instead of a video/audiocodec or parameter to get a list of supported options.

.TP
\fImpeg\fP:
  Syntax: -F "<base-profile>[,<resizer-mode>[,user-profile]]"
    <base-profile> can be one of
      '1' = MPEG 1 (default)
      'b' = big MPEG 1 (experimental)
      'v' = VCD
      's' = SVCD
      '2' = MPEG2
      'd' = DVD compliant
    <resizer-mode> can be one of
       0 = disable resizer (default)
       1 = 352x288
       2 = 480x480
       3 = 480x576
       4 = 352x240
    <user-profile> is a filename of the profile file. You can either specify the absolute path to the file or if you transcode will look for it in the directory where you started transcode.

.TP
\fImpeg2enc\fP:
  Syntax: -F "<base-profile>[,<options_string>]"
    <base-profile> can be one of
      '0' = Generic MPEG1 (default)
      '1' = Standard VCD
      '2' = User VCD
      '3' = Generic MPEG2
      '4' = Standard SVCD
      '5' = User SVCD
      '6' = Manual parameter mode
      '8' = DVD
    <options_string> will be passed down to mpeg2enc untouched by transcode. Have a look at the manpage for mpeg2enc.

.TP
\fIraw\fP:
  The name of the image format to use for uncompressed video. Examples are I420 (YUV 4:2:0 planar), YV12 (the same thing with U and V reversed), or UYVY (YUV 4:2:2 packed). Use "-F help" to get a list of formats.

.SH EXPORT MODULES
If no module is specified through the \fI-y\fP option, transcode will use
the \fInull\fP module for both audio and video export. If a multiplex module
is given, by giving \fBthree\fP export module names instead the usual two,
transcode will use the new-style encode/multiplex modules (still under development,
see the encode and multiplex directories); if no multiplex module is given,
the traditional export modules will be used.
