Then this might be for you.

Transcode has a lot of filter plugins which are not optimized. Filters
in transcode usually get a single video frame and do transformations on
that frame. The filter API is as simple as efficient it is explained in
great detail in /docs/filter-API.txt with sample code for a dummy
filter.

All filters in transcode are in the filter/ directory and are mostly a
single C file. The variety of filters ranges from very simple filters
-- like filter_invert.c -- to complex stuff like filter_yuvdenoise.c.

The audio filters  are per definition less CPU intensive than the video
filters because they have to deal with less data.

Here is an overview of filters which would be glad about a speedup
(lexicographical order)

* filter_32detect.c
  Is a interlace detection plugin. The detection algorithm could be
  improved as well as the speed.

* filter_aclip.c
  Audio filter which generate audio clips from source

* filter_astat.c
  Audio filter which collects statistics about the audio stream.

* filter_cshift.c
  A chroma-lag shifter. It shifts the color components of the video to
  the left or right.  For RGB mode, the filter converts the data to YUV and
  back again.

* filter_dnr.c
  A denoiser with no SIMD optimizations It uses a different algorithm
  than the yuvdenoiser.

* filter_fields.c
  A very efficient and well written filter.

* filter_invert.c
  Simple filter which inverts the video.

* filter_logo.c
  renders a logo into the video stream.

* filter_logoaway.c
  removes a logo from the video stream.

* filter_mask.c
  Filter through a rectangular mask, everything outside the masked will
  be blacked out.

* filter_normalize.c
  Normalizes the audio stream. The filter is based on mplayers volnorm
  filter.

* filter_resample.c
  Resamples to audio stream doing conversions from eg. 48000Hz to
  44100Hz. The code is based on code from the sox application.

* filter_smartdeinter.c
  This filter provides a smart, motion-based deinterlacing
  capability. In static picture areas, interlacing artifacts do
  not appear, so data from both fields is used to provide full
  detail. In moving areas, deinterlacing is performed.

  The filter was written for VirtualDub by Donald Graft. It produces
  very good results. It was written with the RGB colorspace in mind. To
  use it in transcode with YUV mode enabled a yuv2rgb and rgb2yuv
  wrapper has been built around this filter. It would speed up a lot, if
  rewritten for native YUV mode. There are probably other areas in this
  filter which are a candidate for a speedup.

* filter_smooth.c
  Is a single-frame smoothing plugin. It is very CPU intensive

* filter_testframe.c
  It generates stream of testframes. Optimizing this filter is probably
  not worth it but it is a good testbed for generating problematic
  testframes.

* filter_xsharpen.c
  This filter performs a subtle but useful sharpening effect. The
  result is a sharpening effect that not only avoids amplifying
  noise, but also tends to reduce it. A welcome side effect is that
  files processed with this filter tend to compress to smaller files.

  The filter was written for VirtualDub by Donald Graft.  It was written
  with the RGB colorspace in mind. To be useful with transcodes YUV
  mode, the filter has been partially rewritten.

* filter_yuvdenoise.c
  This filter comes from the mjpeg tools and denoises the video by doing
  a motion analyse. There are some SIMD parts in this filter but it could
  be much faster.

* filter_yuvmedian.c
  This filter comes from the mjpeg tools and smoothes the video by
  appying a median algorithm. It is CPU intensive.

Colorspaces
In transcode, the filter gets a char* which points to the raw video
data. Only two colorspaces are possible in transcode.

* RGB
This is actually RGB24 meaning there are 24 bits or 3 Bytes available
for each pixel. It is a packed format, each component is 1 byte large.
The size of the image is Width*Height*3.
The memory layout is

 ___________________________________
|__R__|__G__|__B__|__R__|__G__|__B__| ....
 \_______________/ \_______________/
    Pixel(0,0)        Pixel(1,0)

* YUV (4:2:0)
This is actually YUV420P (I420) with 1+1/2 byte per pixel. It is a planar
format meaning first all Y data then Cb and then Cr.
The memory layout is

 __________________ ...  ______  ...  _____
|__Y__|__Y__|__Y__| ... |__Cb_|  ... |__Cr_| ....
 \___/ \___/ \___/
 (0,0) (1,0) (2,0)

There are Width*Height Y bytes, Width*Height/4 Cb bytes and
Width*Height/4 Cr bytes. The size of the image is Width*Height*3/2.


* YUV (4:2:2)
This is YUV422 8-bit planar, with 2 bytes per pixel.  The layout is the
same as for YUV420P, but the Cb and Cr planes are twice as high (double
vertical resolution).

Size of the image is 2*W*H.
