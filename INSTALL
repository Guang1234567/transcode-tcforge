Transcode compiles even if you do not have all additional libs
installed. You do not *need* to have a "yes" on every configure check.

You will need to have libavcodec (also known as ffmpeg libraries)
installed somewhere on your computer. Without libavcodec and libavformat
transcode doesn't compile. The best way to accomplish this is to get FFmpeg 
from svn (ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu), configure it with at least --enable-shared
and --enable-pthreads compile and install it. (Also see the notes below
about libpostproc if you plan to use filter_pp.) A package of some kind
that includes libavcodec.so and the headers will do as well. If the
files are installed in a non-default location (transcode assumes prefix:
/usr), then you will need to tell transcode where they live. Very
important: you _need_ both the header files _and_ shared libraries files.
The static libraries won't do!

Depending on what you want to do with transcode you may need additional
packages installed. In particular, a recent version of lame is needed
for encoding MP2/MP3 audio, and liba52 is required for decoding AC3
audio (as is used on some DVDs).

If you obtained transcode using CVS, you will need to generate the
"configure" script yourself while in the snapshot tarballs it's
included. To do this you need _recent_ versions of autoconf (>= 2.59),
automake (>= 1.8) and libtool (>= 1.5) utilities. Now to make the
configure script, run "autoreconf -i -f". Do not use "autoreconf -if"
because this does not work on some distributions.

Now run

 ./configure --help

to get some idea of the many optional packages that can be incorporated.
Note the *--enable-$$$* and *--with-$$$* flags.

ONLY PACKAGES THAT ARE ENABLED EXPLICITLY USING CONFIGURE ARE ACTUALLY
USED TO BUILD MODULES.

If you have any optimisations your C compiler supports and you want to
use, put them in the environment ./configure is run in. It pays off to
study all the optimisation flags your C compiler offers. Some of these
may be useful, and some may cause problems, that is why transcode itself
does not use any optimization flags unless absolutely necessary. For
instance, if you are going to be running transcode on a Pentium4 system
and building with *gcc*, you can invoke configure like this:

 $ env CFLAGS="-O3 -march=pentium4" ./configure ...

to create an optimised build,

or

 $ env CFLAGS="-g" ./configure ...

to build transcode for debugging.

Don't forget the relevant configure options, described below.

Then:

  make
  make install

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Configure options for transcode*

Configure will not test for a package unless support is enabled. For
example, configure will not look for SDL unless the option
'--enable-sdl' is used. If a package distributes pkg-config information,
or if a package distributes it's own -config script (like libquicktime's
lqt-config), configure will use information from pkg-config or the
package's script to find the package's headers and libraries.  Otherwise,
configure will look in the default prefix, /usr.  This means that by
default configure will look for the headers in /usr/include and the
libraries in /usr/lib.

The options dealing with file locations can be used to tell configure
to look in other locations for headers and libraries. The prefix to
search can be changed with the --with-$$$-prefix options. Specific
directories for libraries and headers can be given with --with-$$$-libs
and --with-$$$-includes, respectively. If the header and library
specific options are used, configure will use the paths given with
those options, and will not use paths from pkg-config or a package's
-config script. NOTE: the --with-$$$-prefix option does not override
pkg-config or -config information. configure will use the prefix to
search for a package's -config script.

If configure is unable to find support for a mandatory or optionally
enabled package, configure will exit with an error and display a message
about the error.

For the options described below, the default value is in parenthesis
after the option.
